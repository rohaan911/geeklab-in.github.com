##Update: The GeekLab project has now been discontinued.

# Official [GeekLab]blog
Uses [Jekyll 2.0.3](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Incorporated theme](http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/) by Inc.

##Documentation

The source has been separated from the content to allow GitHub pages to parse third-party plugins used. Read [David Ensinger's tutorial](http://davidensinger.com/2013/04/deploying-jekyll-to-github-pages/) or [Charlie Park's tutorial](http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/) to learn more.

The *source* branch contains the Jekyll source files and the *master* branch contains the generated static site content.

Everything else is according to standard Jekyll format.
